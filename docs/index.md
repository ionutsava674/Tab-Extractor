# Tab Extractor 1

Very accessible guitar tabs

## Overview

                Tab Extractor is a tool created to help visually impaired people to read guitar tabs more easily.

For example, instead of having a tab displayed like:

`e|------0---/------------|`

`B|----3-2---/----3-2-3-2-|`

`G|----4-2---/----4-2-4-2-|`

`D|---------4/------------|`

`A|-2--------/-2----------|`

`E|----------/------------|`

the notes will be listed like this:

A; 2

B; 3. G; 4

e; 0. B; 2. G; 2

D; 4

A; 2

B; 3. G; 4

B; 2. G; 2
