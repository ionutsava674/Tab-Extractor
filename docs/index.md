# Tab Extractor

**_Very accessible guitar tabs_**

### **Overview**

Tab Extractor is an IOS mobile app created to help visually impaired people to read guitar tabs more easily.

Usually guitar tabs are very hard to access using screen readers.

Tab extractor makes it easy and fun to read and navigate guitar tabs by laying out the information in a list form, position by position.

For example, instead of having a tab displayed like:

`e|------0---/------------|`

`B|----3-2---/----3-2-3-2-|`

`G|----4-2---/----4-2-4-2-|`

`D|---------4/------------|`

`A|-2--------/-2----------|`

`E|----------/------------|`

the notes will be listed like this:

A; 2

B; 3. G; 4

e; 0. B; 2. G; 2

etc

which makes it a lot more easy to read.
You get the order of the notes, plus, notes that are supposed to be played at the same time, are listed in the same line.

Screen readers are great tools that help us access and also input information.

### **Main features**

- automatically detects guitar tabs on a web page
- lets you save each tab individually or all together
